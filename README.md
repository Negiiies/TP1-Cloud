## Getting Started

1. **Build and Run**: 
   Use `docker-compose up -d --build` to start the containers in the background.

2. **Access the Web Server**: 
   Go to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

3. **Connect to MySQL**: 
   Use the command `mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u user -p` to connect to the database.

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is running before executing commands.
- Stop the containers with `docker-compose down`.
